# CS3 - Knowledge Management System API

This is the backend side of an experimental distraction-free Q&A system. It is inspired from the massive repetitive Q&As during the pre-enrollment of incoming freshmen at my university.

Students will simply look for an answer of their question by searching the system. Otherwise, they can ask and provide us their email so they'll be notified when an answer comes out. On the other hand, students who have the same unanswered question can join the waitlist, which help eliminate redundant questions.

This API is hosted in Heroku for public use.

## Requirements
- PHP Version >= 8.0
- Postgres >= 14.0
